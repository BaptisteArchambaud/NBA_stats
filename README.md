# NBA_stats

This is an exploratory project of NBA statistics data vizualisation. I created a Dash application with Python that displays time series of yearly players statistics. 

The data that I used comes from API package [basketball_reference_web_scraper](https://github.com/jaebradley/basketball_reference_web_scraper), which extracts data from the website [Basketball Reference](http://www.basketball-reference.com).

To use the app, follow these steps :
1. Create a virtual environment for your project
2. Import all libraries specified in requirements.txt
3. Lauch the file app.py

Project compatible with Python >= 3.12.7.
